# Race Rules
Race rules for Pokémon Snap Team Grand Prix

---

## Stream Setup
- Runners **must** have the entire game viewable on stream
- Runners *should* have a timer on stream
  - A request from a TA can make it mandatory
- Runners *should* record their streams to a VOD
- Runners **must** have their recorded runs publicly available to a TA within 1 hour of the end of the race

## Speedrun Rules
- The rules will follow the same as on [speedrun.com](speedrun.com/pkmnsnap) for Any% runs of Pokémon Snap
- Runners with a PB under 21:30 cannot run on WiiU VC, unless every race participant is as well, to ensure a fair experience
- Future events of different categories will apply the same rules (timing limits will change)

## DNF
- If a runner does not finish their run, whether by technical difficulties or personal choice, they will receive 0 points
  - A runner can complete a run even if reset -- but their time will continue from the initial run
- All runs that take more than 1 hour are considered to be DNF and will recieve 0 points, regardless of completion
