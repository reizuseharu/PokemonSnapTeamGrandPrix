# Tournament Rules
Tournament rules for Pokémon Snap Team Grand Prix

---

## Registration

### Runner
- Each runner will signup using [Pokémon Snap Team Grand Prix's Registration page](tgp.pkmnsnap.com/registration)
- Registration will require Twitch Username, Personal Best for Any% (including console and cart region), and a link to a video of the Personal Best
- A Tournament Administrator will review and validate each registration to verify PB
  - Runs on speedrun.com/pkmnsnap will be automatically validated
- To register for the tournament you **must** have completed **at least** 1 run of Any%
- Registration for becoming a Tournament Administrator will be through [Pokémon Snap Team Grand Prix's Adminstration Registration page](tgp.pkmnsnap.com/registration/administrator)


### Leader
- Team leaders may apply and will be selected by random chance of those applied

#### Convoluted method of choosing Leader
- Each Team Leader applicant will be assigned a random number
- The TO will start River and see if all Cloysters appear to decide which leaders are accepted
  - i.e. If all 4 cloysters appear on an attempt, then that leader will be selected. If after N attempts not all slots are filled, it will rotate
  - e.g. 7 people apply to be team leader when only 4 can be selected; CJ applies to be leader and is assigned the number 2
    - (1) Attempt 1: 2
    - (2) Attempt 2: 0
    - (3) Attempt 3: 4 &rarr; **Leader `3` SELECTED**
    - ...
    - (7) Attempt 7: 1
    - (1) Attempt 8: 3
    - (2) Attempt 9: 4 &rarr; **Leader `2` [CJ] SELECTED**
    - (4) Attempt 10: 4 &rarr; **Leader `4` SELECTED**
    - ...
- Team Leader selection will be streamed on twitch.tv/PokemonSnapTeamGrandPrix

## Team Setup
- After all runners have been registered, they will be ranked according to their placement amongst the other runners, and assigned a value
- Each team will be allotted an amount of points based on an average of the runner applicants
  - e.g. 17 applicants totaling 255 runner points and 4 teams &rarr; 64 runner points/team
- After all team leaders have been chosen, they will be given a chance to pick their team in a draft, on a reverse skill basis i.e. Team Leader with the worst PB gets first pick
- There is not a required amount of runners per team, but there is per race, so team leaders must keep this in mind when selecting the makeup
- Once teams have been selected, they will be assigned a logo based on one of the courses in Pokémon Snap (e.g. Volcano), and the team must select a name
  - This team will have a page on [Pokémon Snap Team Grand Prix's Team Page](tgp.pkmnsnap.com/teams)
- Team selection will be streamed on twitch.tv/PokemonSnapTeamGrandPrix

## Race Scheduling
- The tournament will run between dates selected by the TO after community feedback, and given to runner applicants as registration is open
- On a weekly(?) basis, team leaders must schedule races against their required teams with a minimum amount of runners (amount depends on amount of registered runners per team)
  - This minimum will be given to team leaders after selection and publicly available

### Invalid Races
- If a team's required minimum amount of runners is not met, they will face a point penalty (TBD)
- If a team cannot schedule a race within a week they will receive 0 points
  - The other team will not receive any points unless they race with the minimum allowed of team
- If neither team can schedule time, races can be run asynchronously, but each run must be coordinated with a TA and recorded

## Stream Setup
- Each runner **must** stream their races on a publicly available twitch channel
- Each runner **must** record their races in some manner: as a Twitch VOD or a local recording is fine as long as a TA verified the time at the time of execution
  - If a recording is not available when a TA wants to verify a run, it does not count
- Races will stream a random member of each team on twitch.tv/PokemonSnapTeamGrandPrix
  - Preference will be given to runners with closest times first, then to runners with faster PBs
- Asynchronous runs might be run on team channels: e.g. twitch.tv/PokemonSnapVolcano
  - This is at the discretion of the TA

## Score
- Scores after a race will take a Racing league approach
  - Every runner will gain points if they completed a race
  - Runners with faster times for a specific race will get higher points
